<i>Interior of a coachbuilder’s workshop. Parts of a
gilded coach, among them an ornament representing
a lion and unicorn. <span class="small">THOMAS</span> working at a

room.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I have prayed over Martin. I have prayed
a long time, but there is no move in him yet.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>You are giving yourself too much trouble,
Father. It’s as good for you to leave him alone
till the doctor’s bottle will come. If there is
any cure at all for what is on him, it is likely
the doctor will have it.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I think it is not doctor’s medicine will help
him in this case.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It will, it will. The doctor has his business
learned well. If Andrew had gone to him the
time I bade him and had not turned again to
bring yourself to the house, it is likely Martin
would be walking at this time. I am loth to
trouble you, Father, when the business is not
of your own sort. Any doctor at all should be
able and well able to cure the falling sickness.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>It is not any common sickness that is on him
now.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>I thought at the first it was gone to sleep he
was. But when shaking him and roaring at him
failed to rouse him, I knew well it was the falling
sickness. Believe me, the doctor will reach
it with his drugs.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Nothing but prayer can reach a soul that is
so far beyond the world as his soul is at this
moment.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>You are not saying that the life is gone out
of him!</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>No, no, his life is in no danger. But where
he himself, the spirit, the soul, is gone, I cannot
say. It has gone beyond our imaginings.
He is fallen into a trance.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>He used to be queer as a child, going asleep
in the fields, and coming back with talk of
white horses he saw, and bright people like
angels or whatever they were. But I mended
that. I taught him to recognise stones beyond
angels with a few strokes of a rod. I would
never give in to visions or to trances.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>We who hold the faith have no right to
speak against trance or vision. Saint Elizabeth
had them, Saint Benedict, Saint Anthony, Saint
Columcille. Saint Catherine of Siena often lay
a long time as if dead.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>That might be so in the olden time, but those
things are gone out of the world now. Those
that do their work fair and honest have no
occasion to let the mind go rambling. What
would send my nephew, Martin Hearne, into
a trance, supposing trances to be in it, and he
rubbing the gold on the lion and unicorn that
he had taken in hand to make a good job of for
the top of the coach?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>taking up ornament</i>].</div>
<p>It is likely it was that sent him off. The
flashing of light upon it would be enough to
throw one that had a disposition to it into a
trance. There was a very saintly man, though
he was not of our church; he wrote a great book
called <i>Mysterium Magnum</i> was seven days in
a trance. Truth, or whatever truth he found,
fell upon him like a bursting shower, and he a
poor tradesman at his work. It was a ray of
sunlight on a pewter vessel that was the beginning
of all. [<i>Goes to the door and looks in.</i>]
There is no stir in him yet. It is either the
best thing or the worst thing can happen to
anyone, that is happening to him now.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>And what in the living world can happen to
a man that is asleep on his bed?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>There are some would answer you that it is
to those who are awake that nothing happens,
and it is they that know nothing. He is gone
where all have gone for supreme truth.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.<br/>
[<i>Sitting down again and taking up tools.</i>]</div>
<p>Well, maybe so. But work must go on and
coachbuilding must go on, and they will not
go on the time there is too much attention
given to dreams. A dream is a sort of a shadow,
no profit in it to anyone at all. A coach, now,
is a real thing and a thing that will last for
generations and be made use of to the last, and
maybe turn to be a hen-roost at its latter end.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I think Andrew told me it was a dream of
Martin’s that led to the making of that coach.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Well, I believe he saw gold in some dream,
and it led him to want to make some golden
thing, and coaches being the handiest, nothing
would do him till he put the most of his fortune
into the making of this golden coach. It turned
out better than I thought, for some of the
lawyers came looking at it at Assize time, and
through them it was heard of at Dublin Castle . . .
and who now has it ordered but the Lord
Lieutenant! [<i><span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> nods.</i>] Ready it
must be and sent off it must be by the end of
the month. It is likely King George will be
visiting Dublin, and it is he himself will be
sitting in it yet.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Martin has been working hard at it, I know.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>You never saw a man work the way he did,
day and night, near ever since the time six
months ago he first came home from France.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I never thought he would be so good at a
trade. I thought his mind was only set on books.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>He should be thankful to myself for that.
Any person I will take in hand, I make a clean
job of them the same as I would make of any
other thing in my yard—coach, half-coach,
hackney-coach, ass-car, common-car, post-chaise,
calash, chariot on two wheels, on four
wheels. Each one has the shape Thomas Hearne
put on it, and it in his hands; and what I can
do with wood and iron, why would I not be
able to do it with flesh and blood, and it in a
way my own?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Indeed, I know you did your best for Martin.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Every best. Checked him, taught him the
trade, sent him to the monastery in France for
to learn the language and to see the wide world;
but who should know that if you did not know
it, Father John, and I doing it according to
your own advice?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I thought his nature needed spiritual guidance
and teaching, the best that could be found.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>I thought myself it was best for him to be
away for a while. There are too many wild lads
about this place. He to have stopped here, he
might have taken some fancies, and got into
some trouble, going against the Government
maybe the same as Johnny Gibbons that is at this
time an outlaw, having a price upon his head.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>That is so. That imagination of his might
have taken fire here at home. It was better
putting him with the Brothers, to turn it to
imaginings of heaven.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Well, I will soon have a good hardy tradesman
made of him now that will live quiet and
rear a family, and be maybe appointed coachbuilder
to the Royal Family at the last.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>at window</i>].</div>
<p>I see your brother Andrew coming back from
the doctor; he is stopping to talk with a troop
of beggars that are sitting by the side of the road.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>There, now, is another that I have shaped.
Andrew used to be a bit wild in his talk and
in his ways, wanting to go rambling, not content
to settle in the place where he was reared.
But I kept a guard over him; I watched the
time poverty gave him a nip, and then I settled
him into the business. He never was so good
a worker as Martin, he is too fond of wasting
his time talking vanities. But he is middling
handy, and he is always steady and civil to customers.
I have no complaint worth while to be
making this last twenty years against Andrew.</p>
<div class="enter">[<i><span class="small">ANDREW</span> comes in.</i>]</div>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Beggars there outside going the road to the
Kinvara fair. They were saying there is news
that Johnny Gibbons is coming back from
France on the quiet; the king’s soldiers are
watching the ports for him.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Let you keep now, Andrew, to the business
you have in hand. Will the doctor be coming
himself or did he send a bottle that will cure
Martin?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>The doctor can’t come, for he’s down with
the lumbago in the back. He questioned me
as to what ailed Martin, and he got a book to
go looking for a cure, and he began telling me
things out of it, but I said I could not be
carrying things of that sort in my head. He
gave me the book then, and he has marks put
in it for the places where the cures are . . .
wait now. . . . [<i>Reads</i>] ‘Compound medicines
are usually taken inwardly, or outwardly applied;
inwardly taken, they should be either
liquid or solid; outwardly, they should be fomentations
or sponges wet in some decoctions.’</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>He had a right to have written it out himself
upon a paper. Where is the use of all
that?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I think I moved the mark maybe . . . here,
now, is the part he was reading to me himself. . . .
‘The remedies for diseases belonging to
the skins next the brain, headache, vertigo,
cramp, convulsions, palsy, incubus, apoplexy,
falling sickness.’</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It is what I bid you to tell him that it was
the falling sickness.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW [<i>dropping book</i>].</div>
<p>O, my dear, look at all the marks gone out
of it! Wait, now, I partly remember what he
said . . . a blister he spoke of . . . or to be
smelling hartshorn . . . or the sneezing powder . . .
or if all fails, to try letting the blood.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>All this has nothing to do with the real case.
It is all waste of time.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>That is what I was thinking myself, Father.
Sure it was I was the first to call out to you when
I saw you coming down from the hill-side, and
to bring you in to see what could you do. I
would have more trust in your means than in
any doctor’s learning. And in case you might
fail to cure him, I have a cure myself I heard
from my grandmother—God rest her soul!—and
she told me she never knew it to fail. A
person to have the falling sickness, to cut the
top of his nails and a small share of the hair of
his head, and to put it down on the floor, and
to take a harry-pin and drive it down with
that into the floor and to leave it there. ‘That
is the cure will never fail,’ she said, ‘to rise up
any person at all having the falling sickness.’</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>hand on ear</i>].</div>
<p>I will go back to the hill-side, I will go back
to the hill-side; but no, no, I must do what I
can. I will go again, I will wrestle, I will
strive my best to call him back with prayer.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>Goes in and shuts door.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>It is queer Father John is sometimes, and
very queer. There are times when you would
say that he believes in nothing at all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>If you wanted a priest, why did you not get
our own parish priest that is a sensible man,
and a man that you would know what his
thoughts are? You know well the bishop
should have something against Father John to
have left him through the years in that poor
mountainy place, minding the few unfortunate
people that were left out of the last famine.
A man of his learning to be going in rags the
way he is, there must be some good cause for
that.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I had all that in mind and I bringing him.
But I thought he would have done more for
Martin than what he is doing. To read a
Mass over him I thought he would, and to be
convulsed in the reading it, and some strange
thing to have gone out with a great noise
through the doorway.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It would give no good name to the place
such a thing to be happening in it. It is well
enough for labouring-men and for half-acre
men. It would be no credit at all such a thing
to be heard of in this house, that is for coachbuilding
the capital of the county.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>If it is from the devil this sickness comes, it
would be best to put it out whatever way it
would be put out. But there might no bad thing
be on the lad at all. It is likely he was with
wild companions abroad, and that knocking
about might have shaken his health. I was
that way myself one time.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Father John said that it was some sort of a
vision or a trance, but I would give no heed
to what he would say. It is his trade to see
more than other people would see, the same
as I myself might be seeing a split in a leather
car hood that no other person would find out
at all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>If it is the falling sickness is on him, I have
no objection to that—a plain, straight sickness
that was cast as a punishment on the unbelieving
Jews. It is a thing that might attack one
of a family, and one of another family, and not
to come upon their kindred at all. A person
to have it, all you have to do is not to go between
him and the wind, or fire, or water. But
I am in dread trance is a thing might run
through the house the same as the cholera
morbus.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>In my belief there is no such thing as a
trance. Letting on people do be to make the
world wonder the time they think well to rise
up. To keep them to their work is best, and
not to pay much attention to them at all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I would not like trances to be coming on
myself. I leave it in my will if I die without
cause, a holly-stake to be run through my heart
the way I will lie easy after burial, and not
turn my face downwards in my coffin. I tell
you I leave it on you in my will.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Leave thinking of your own comforts,
Andrew, and give your mind to the business.
Did the smith put the irons yet on to the shafts
of this coach?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I will go see did he.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Do so, and see did he make a good job of
it. Let the shafts be sound and solid if they
are to be studded with gold.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>They are, and the steps along with them—glass
sides for the people to be looking in at
the grandeur of the satin within—the lion
and the unicorn crowning all. It was a great
thought Martin had the time he thought of
making this coach!</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It is best for me to go see the smith myself
and leave it to no other one. You can be
attending to that ass-car out in the yard wants a
new tyre in the wheel—out in the rear of the
yard it is. [<i>They go to door.</i>] To pay attention
to every small thing, and to fill up every
minute of time shaping whatever you have to
do, that is the way to build up a business.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>They go out.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>bringing in <span class="small">MARTIN</span></i>].</div>
<p>They are gone out now—the air is fresher
here in the workshop—you can sit here for a
while. You are now fully awake, you have
been in some sort of a trance or a sleep.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Who was it that pulled at me? Who
brought me back?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>It is I, Father John, did it. I prayed a long
time over you and brought you back.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You, Father John, to be so unkind! O leave
me, leave me alone!</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You are in your dream still.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It was no dream, it was real. Do you not
smell the broken fruit—the grapes? the room
is full of the smell.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Tell me what you have seen, where you
have been?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>There were horses—white horses rushing
by, with white shining riders—there was a
horse without a rider, and someone caught me
up and put me upon him and we rode away,
with the wind, like the wind—</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>That is a common imagining. I know many
poor persons have seen that.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>We went on, on, on. We came to a sweet-smelling
garden with a gate to it, and there
were wheatfields in full ear around, and there
were vineyards like I saw in France, and the
grapes in bunches. I thought it to be one of
the townlands of heaven. Then I saw the
horses we were on had changed to unicorns, and
they began trampling the grapes and breaking
them. I tried to stop them but I could not.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>That is strange, that is strange. What is it
that brings to mind? I heard it in some place,
<i>monoceros de astris</i>, the unicorn from the stars.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>They tore down the wheat and trampled it on
stones, and then they tore down what were left
of grapes and crushed and bruised and trampled
them. I smelt the wine, it was flowing on
every side—then everything grew vague. I
cannot remember clearly, everything was silent;
the trampling now stopped, we were all waiting
for some command. Oh! was it given!
I was trying to hear it; there was someone
dragging, dragging me away from that. I am
sure there was a command given, and there
was a great burst of laughter. What was it?
What was the command? Everything seemed
to tremble round me.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Did you awake then?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I do not think I did, it all changed—it was
terrible, wonderful! I saw the unicorns trampling,
trampling, but not in the wine troughs.
Oh, I forget! Why did you waken me?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I did not touch you. Who knows what
hands pulled you away? I prayed, that was all
I did. I prayed very hard that you might
awake. If I had not, you might have died. I
wonder what it all meant? The unicorns—what
did the French monk tell me?—strength
they meant, virginal strength, a rushing, lasting,
tireless strength.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>They were strong. Oh, they made a great
noise with their trampling.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>And the grapes, what did they mean? It puts
me in mind of the psalm, <i>Et calix meus inebrians
quam præclarus est</i>. It was a strange vision, a
very strange vision, a very strange vision.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>How can I get back to that place?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You must not go back, you must not think
of doing that. That life of vision, of contemplation,
is a terrible life, for it has far more of
temptation in it than the common life. Perhaps
it would have been best for you to stay under
rules in the monastery.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I could not see anything so clearly there.
It is back here in my own place the visions
come, in the place where shining people used
to laugh around me, and I a little lad in a bib.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You cannot know but it was from the Prince
of this world the vision came. How can one ever
know unless one follows the discipline of the
Church? Some spiritual director, some wise
learned man, that is what you want. I do not
know enough. What am I but a poor banished
priest, with my learning forgotten, my books
never handled and spotted with the damp!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I will go out into the fields where you cannot
come to me to awake me. I will see that townland
again; I will hear that command. I cannot
wait, I must know what happened, I must
bring that command to mind again.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.<br/>
[<i>Putting himself between <span class="small">MARTIN</span> and the door.</i>]</div>
<p>You must have patience as the saints had it.
You are taking your own way. If there is a
command from God for you, you must wait
His good time to receive it.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Must I live here forty years, fifty years . . .
to grow as old as my uncles, seeing nothing but
common things, doing work . . . some foolish
work?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Here they are coming; it is time for me to
go. I must think and I must pray. My mind
is troubled about you. [<i>To <span class="small">THOMAS</span> as he and
<span class="small">ANDREW</span> come in.</i>] Here he is; be very kind to
him for he has still the weakness of a little
child.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>Goes out.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Are you well of the fit, lad?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It was no fit. I was away—for awhile—no,
you will not believe me if I tell you.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I would believe it, Martin. I used to have
very long sleeps myself and very queer dreams.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>You had, till I cured you, taking you in
hand and binding you to the hours of the clock.
The cure that will cure yourself, Martin, and
will waken you, is to put the whole of your
mind on to your golden coach; to take it in
hand and to finish it out of face.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Not just now. I want to think—to try and
remember what I saw, something that I heard,
that I was told to do.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>No, but put it out of your mind. There is no
man doing business that can keep two things in
his head. A Sunday or a holy-day, now, you
might go see a good hurling or a thing of the
kind, but to be spreading out your mind on
anything outside of the workshop on common
days, all coachbuilding would come to an end.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I don’t think it is building I want to do. I
don’t think that is what was in the command.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It is too late to be saying that, the time you
have put the most of your fortune in the business.
Set yourself now to finish your job, and
when it is ended maybe I won’t begrudge you
going with the coach as far as Dublin.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>That is it, that will satisfy him. I had a
great desire myself, and I young, to go travelling
the roads as far as Dublin. The roads are
the great things, they never come to an end.
They are the same as the serpent having his
tail swallowed in his own mouth.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It was not wandering I was called to. What
was it? what was it?</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>What you are called to, and what everyone
having no great estate is called to, is to work.
Sure the world itself could not go on without
work.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I wonder if that is the great thing, to make
the world go on? No, I don’t think that is
the great thing—what does the Munster poet
call it?—‘this crowded slippery coach-loving
world.’ I don’t think I was told to work for that.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I often thought that myself. It is a pity the
stock of the Hearnes to be asked to do any
work at all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Rouse yourself, Martin, and don’t be talking
the way a fool talks. You started making that
golden coach, and you were set upon it, and
you had me tormented about it. You have
yourself wore out working at it, and planning it,
and thinking of it, and at the end of the race,
when you have the winning-post in sight, and
horses hired for to bring it to Dublin Castle,
you go falling into sleeps and blathering about
dreams, and we run to a great danger of letting
the profit and the sale go by. Sit down on the

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN [<i>sitting down</i>].</div>
<p>I will try. I wonder why I ever wanted to
make it; it was no good dream set me doing
that. [<i>He takes up wheel.</i>] What is there in a
wooden wheel to take pleasure in it? Gilding
it outside makes it no different.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>That is right, now. You had some good
plan for making the axle run smooth.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.<br/>
[<i>Letting wheel fall and putting his hands to his head.</i>]</div>
<p>It is no use. [<i>Angrily.</i>] Why did you send
the priest to awake me? My soul is my own
and my mind is my own. I will send them to
where I like. You have no authority over my
thoughts.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>That is no way to be speaking to me. I am
head of this business. Nephew, or no nephew,
I will have no one come cold or unwilling to
the work.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I had better go; I am of no use to you. I
am going—I must be alone—I will forget if I
am not alone. Give me what is left of my
money and I will go out of this.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.<br/>
[<i>Opening a press and taking out a bag and
throwing it to him.</i>]</div>
<p>There is what is left of your money! The
rest of it you have spent on the coach. If you
want to go, go, and I will not have to be
annoyed with you from this out.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Come now with me, Thomas. The boy
is foolish, but it will soon pass over. He has
not my sense to be giving attention to what
you will say. Come along now, leave him for
awhile; leave him to me I say, it is I will get
inside his mind.</p>
<div class="hang2">[<i>He leads <span class="small">THOMAS</span> out. <span class="small">MARTIN</span> bangs door

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.<br/>
[<i>Opening door and putting in his head.</i>]</div>
<p>Listen to me, Martin.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Go away, no more talking; leave me alone.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>O, but wait. I understand you. Thomas
doesn’t understand your thoughts, but I understand
them. Wasn’t I telling you I was just
like you once?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Like me? Did you ever see the other things,
the things beyond?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I did. It is not the four walls of the house
keep me content. Thomas doesn’t know. Oh,
no, he doesn’t know.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>No, he has no vision.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>He has not, nor any sort of a heart for a
frolic.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>He has never heard the laughter and the
music beyond.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>He has not, nor the music of my own little
flute. I have it hidden in the thatch outside.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Does the body slip from you as it does from
me? They have not shut your window into
eternity?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Thomas never shut a window I could not
get through. I knew you were one of my own
sort. When I am sluggish in the morning,
Thomas says, ‘Poor Andrew is getting old.’
That is all he knows. The way to keep young
is to do the things youngsters do. Twenty
years I have been slipping away, and he never
found me out yet!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That is what they call ecstasy, but there is
no word that can tell out very plain what it
means. That freeing of the mind from its
thoughts, those wonders we know when we
put them into words; the words seem as little
like them as blackberries are like the moon and
sun.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>I found that myself the time they knew me
to be wild, and used to be asking me to say
what pleasure did I find in cards, and women,
and drink.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You might help me to remember that vision
I had this morning, to understand it. The
memory of it has slipped from me. Wait, it
is coming back, little by little. I know that I
saw the unicorns trampling, and then a figure,
a many-changing figure, holding some bright
thing. I knew something was going to happen
or to be said, something that would make my
whole life strong and beautiful like the rushing
of the unicorns, and then, and then—</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN [<i>to <span class="small">ANDREW</span></i>].</div>
<p>I was trying to remember it—when he spoke
that word it all came back to me. I saw a bright
many-changing figure; it was holding up a
shining vessel [<i>holds up arms</i>]; then the vessel
fell and was broken with a great crash; then I
saw the unicorns trampling it. They were
breaking the world to pieces—when I saw the
cracks coming I shouted for joy! And I heard
the command ‘Destroy, destroy, destruction is
the life-giver! destroy!’</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>It was the hunger brought me in and the

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Were you given any other message? Did

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>To destroy, to overthrow all that comes between
us and God, between us and that shining
country. To break the wall, Andrew, to break
the thing—whatever it is that comes between,
but where to begin—</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>What is it you are talking about?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It may be that this man is the beginning.
He has been sent—the poor, they have nothing,
and so they can see heaven as we cannot. He
and his comrades will understand me. But how
to give all men high hearts that they may all
understand?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>It’s the juice of the grey barley will do that.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<div class="hang1"><i>The same workshop. <span class="small">MARTIN</span> seen arranging mugs

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Come in, come in, I have got the house ready.
Here is bread and meat—everybody is welcome.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>Hearing no answer, turns round.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Martin, I have come back. There is something
I want to say to you.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You are welcome, there are others coming.
They are not of your sort, but all are welcome.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I have remembered suddenly something that
I read when I was in the seminary.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You seem very tired.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>sitting down</i>].</div>
<p>I had almost got back to my own place
when I thought of it. I have run part of the
way. It is very important; it is about the trance
that you have been in. When one is inspired
from above, either in trance or in contemplation,
one remembers afterwards all that one has
seen and read. I think there must be something
about it in St. Thomas. I know that I
have read a long passage about it years ago. But,
Martin, there is another kind of inspiration, or
rather an obsession or possession. A diabolical
power comes into one’s body, or overshadows
it. Those whose bodies are taken hold of in this
way, jugglers, and witches, and the like, can
often tell what is happening in distant places,
or what is going to happen, but when they
come out of that state they remember nothing.
I think you said—</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That I could not remember.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You remembered something, but not all.
Nature is a great sleep; there are dangerous
and evil spirits in her dreams, but God is above
Nature. She is a darkness, but He makes
everything clear; He is light.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>All is clear now. I remember all, or all that
matters to me. A poor man brought me a
word, and I know what I have to do.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Ah, I understand, words were put into his
mouth. I have read of such things. God
sometimes uses some common man as his messenger.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You may have passed the man who brought
it on the road. He left me but now.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Very likely, very likely, that is the way it
happened. Some plain, unnoticed man has
sometimes been sent with a command.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I saw the unicorns trampling in my dream.
They were breaking the world. I am to destroy,
destruction was the word the messenger spoke.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>To destroy?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>To bring again the old disturbed exalted life,
the old splendour.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You are not the first that dream has come to.
[<i>Gets up, and walks up and down.</i>] It has been
wandering here and there, calling now to this
man, now to that other. It is a terrible dream.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Father John, you have had the same thought.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Men were holy then, there were saints everywhere.
There was reverence; but now it is all
work, business, how to live a long time. Ah, if
one could change it all in a minute, even by
war and violence! There is a cell where Saint
Ciaran used to pray; if one could bring that
time again!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Do not deceive me. You have had the
command.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Why are you questioning me? You are
asking me things that I have told to no one
but my confessor.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>We must gather the crowds together, you
and I.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I have dreamed your dream, it was long ago.
I had your vision.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>And what happened?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>harshly</i>].</div>
<p>It was stopped; that was an end. I was sent
to the lonely parish where I am, where there
was no one I could lead astray. They have
left me there. We must have patience; the
world was destroyed by water, it has yet to be
consumed by fire.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Why should we be patient? To live seventy
years, and others to come after us and live
seventy years it may be; and so from age to
age, and all the while the old splendour dying
more and more.</p>
<div class="hang2">[<i>A noise of shouting. <span class="small">ANDREW</span>, who has been
standing at the door, comes in.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Martin says truth, and he says it well.
Planing the side of a cart or a shaft, is that
life? It is not. Sitting at a desk writing
letters to the man that wants a coach, or to
the man that won’t pay for the one he has got,
is that life, I ask you? Thomas arguing at
you and putting you down—‘Andrew, dear
Andrew, did you put the tyre on that wheel
yet?’ Is that life? Not, it is not. I ask you
all, what do you remember when you are dead?
It’s the sweet cup in the corner of the widow’s
drinking-house that you remember. Ha, ha,
listen to that shouting! That is what the lads
in the village will remember to the last day
they live.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Why are they shouting? What have you
told them?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Never you mind; you left that to me. You
bade me to lift their hearts and I did lift them.
There is not one among them but will have
his head like a blazing tar-barrel before morning.
What did your friend the beggar say?
The juice of the grey barley, he said.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>You accursed villain! You have made them
drunk!</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Not at all, but lifting them to the stars.
That is what Martin bade me to do, and there
is no one can say I did not do it.</p>
<div class="hang2">[<i>A shout at door, and beggars push in a barrel.

you did not take it.</p>

reward did I ever get travelling with you?

Johnny Gibbons, surely, but it seems to me they
were calling him by some other name.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>A man on his keeping might go by a hundred
names. Would he be telling it out to us that
he never saw before, and we with that clutch
of chattering women along with us? Here he
is coming now. Wait till you see is he the lad
I think him to be.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN [<i>coming in</i>].</div>
<p>I will make my banner, I will paint the unicorn
on it. Give me that bit of canvas, there
is paint over here. We will get no help from the
settled men—we will call to the lawbreakers,
the tinkers, the sievemakers, the sheepstealers.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>He begins to make banner.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>That sounds to be a queer name of an army.
Ribbons I can understand, Whiteboys, Rightboys,
Threshers, and Peep o’ Day, but Unicorns
I never heard of before.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>It is not a queer name but a very good name.
[<i>Takes up lion and unicorn.</i>] It is often you saw
that before you in the dock. There is the unicorn
with the one horn, and what it is he is
going against? The lion of course. When he
has the lion destroyed, the crown must fall and
be shivered. Can’t you see it is the League of
the Unicorns is the league that will fight and
destroy the power of England and King George?</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>It is with that banner we will march and the
lads in the quarry with us, it is they will have
the welcome before him! It won’t be long till
we’ll be attacking the Square House! Arms
there are in it, riches that would smother the
world, rooms full of guineas we will put wax
on our shoes walking them; the horses themselves
shod with no less than silver!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN [<i>holding up banner</i>].</div>
<p>There it is ready! We are very few now,
but the army of the Unicorns will be a great
army! [<i>To <span class="small">JOHNNY</span>.</i>] Why have you brought me
the message? Can you remember any more?
Has anything more come to you? You have
been drinking, the clouds upon your mind have
been destroyed. . . . Can you see anything or
hear anything that is beyond the world?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>I can not. I don’t know what do you want
me to tell you at all?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I want to begin the destruction, but I don’t
know where to begin . . . you do not hear
any other voice?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>I do not. I have nothing at all to do with
Freemasons or witchcraft.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>It is Biddy Lally has to do with witchcraft.
It is often she threw the cups and gave out
prophecies the same as Columcille.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>You are one of the knowledgeable women.
You can tell me where it is best to begin, and
what will happen in the end.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>I will foretell nothing at all. I rose out of it
this good while, with the stiffness and the swelling
it brought upon my joints.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>If you have foreknowledge you have no right
to keep silent. If you do not help me I may
go to work in the wrong way. I know I have
to destroy, but when I ask myself what I am
to begin with, I am full of uncertainty.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>Here now are the cups handy and the leavings
in them.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.<br/>
[<i>Taking cups and pouring one from another.</i>]</div>
<p>Throw a bit of white money into the four
corners of the house.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>There! [<i>Throwing it.</i>]</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>There can be nothing told without silver.
It is not myself will have the profit of it. Along
with that I will be forced to throw out gold.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>There is a guinea for you. Tell me what
comes before your eyes.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>What is it you are wanting to have news of?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Of what I have to go out against at the beginning . . .
there is so much . . . the whole
world it may be.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.<br/>
[<i>Throwing from one cup to another and looking.</i>]</div>
<p>You have no care for yourself. You have been
across the sea, you are not long back. You are
coming within the best day of your life.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>What is it? What is it I have to do?</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>I see a great smoke, I see burning . . . there
is a great smoke overhead.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That means we have to burn away a great
deal that men have piled up upon the earth.
We must bring men once more to the wildness
of the clean green earth.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Herbs for my healing, the big herb and the
little herb, it is true enough they get their great
strength out of the earth.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>Who was it the green sod of Ireland belonged
to in the olden times? Wasn’t it to the ancient
race it belonged? And who has possession of
it now but the race that came robbing over the
sea? The meaning of that is to destroy the big
houses and the towns, and the fields to be given
back to the ancient race.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That is it. You don’t put it as I do, but
what matter? Battle is all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>Columcille said, the four corners to be burned,
and then the middle of the field to be burned.
I tell you it was Columcille’s prophecy said that.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Iron handcuffs I see and a rope and a gallows,
and it maybe is not for yourself I see it, but
for some I have acquaintance with a good way
back.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That means the law. We must destroy the
law. That was the first sin, the first mouthful
of the apple.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>So it was, so it was. The law is the worst
loss. The ancient law was for the benefit of all.
It is the law of the English is the only sin.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>When there were no laws men warred on
one another and man to man, not with machines
made in towns as they do now, and they grew
hard and strong in body. They were altogether
alive like him that made them in his image,
like people in that unfallen country. But presently
they thought it better to be safe, as if
safety mattered or anything but the exaltation
of the heart, and to have eyes that danger had
made grave and piercing. We must overthrow
the laws and banish them.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>It is what I say, to put out the laws is to put
out the whole nation of the English. Laws for
themselves they made for their own profit, and
left us nothing at all, no more than a dog or a
sow.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>An old priest I see, and I would not say is
he the one was here or another. Vexed and
troubled he is, kneeling fretting and ever-fretting
in some lonesome ruined place.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I thought it would come to that. Yes, the
Church too—that is to be destroyed. Once
men fought with their desires and their fears,
with all that they call their sins, unhelped, and
their souls became hard and strong. When we
have brought back the clean earth and destroyed
the law and the Church all life will become
like a flame of fire, like a burning eye . . . Oh,
how to find words for it all . . . all that is not
life will pass away.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>It is Luther’s Church he means, and the
humpbacked discourse of Seaghan Calvin’s
Bible. So we will break it, and make an end of it.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>We will go out against the world and break
it and unmake it. [<i>Rising.</i>] We are the army
of the Unicorn from the Stars! We will trample
it to pieces.—We will consume the world, we
will burn it away—Father John said the world
has yet to be consumed by fire. Bring me fire.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW [<i>to <span class="normal">Beggars</span></i>].</div>
<p>Here is Thomas. Hide—let you hide.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>All except <span class="small">MARTIN</span> hurry into next room.
<span class="small">THOMAS</span> comes in.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Come with me, Martin. There is terrible
work going on in the town! There is mischief
gone abroad. Very strange things are happening!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>What are you talking of? What has happened?</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Come along, I say, it must be put a stop to.
We must call to every decent man. It is as if
the devil himself had gone through the town
on a blast and set every drinking-house open!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I wonder how that has happened. Can it
have anything to do with Andrew’s plan?</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Are you giving no heed to what I’m saying?
There is not a man, I tell you, in the parish and
beyond the parish but has left the work he
was doing whether in the field or in the mill.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Then all work has come to an end? Perhaps
that was a good thought of Andrew’s.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>There is not a man has come to sensible
years that is not drunk or drinking! My own
labourers and my own serving-men are sitting
on counters and on barrels! I give you my
word, the smell of the spirits and the porter
and the shouting and the cheering within, made
the hair to rise up on my scalp.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>And yet there is not one of them that does
not feel that he could bridle the four winds.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS [<i>sitting down in despair</i>].</div>
<p>You are drunk too. I never thought you had
a fancy for it.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It is hard for you to understand. You have
worked all your life. You have said to yourself
every morning, ‘What is to be done to-day?’
and when you are tired out you have thought
of the next day’s work. If you gave yourself
an hour’s idleness, it was but that you might
work the better. Yet it is only when one has
put work away that one begins to live.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>It is those French wines that did it.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I have been beyond the earth. In Paradise,
in that happy townland, I have seen the shining
people. They were all doing one thing or another,
but not one of them was at work. All
that they did was but the overflowing of their
idleness, and their days were a dance bred of
the secret frenzy of their hearts, or a battle
where the sword made a sound that was like
laughter.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>You went away sober from out of my hands;
they had a right to have minded you better.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>No man can be alive, and what is paradise
but fulness of life, if whatever he sets his hand
to in the daylight cannot carry him from exaltation
to exaltation, and if he does not rise into
the frenzy of contemplation in the night silence.
Events that are not begotten in joy are misbegotten
and darken the world, and nothing
is begotten in joy if the joy of a thousand years
has not been crushed into a moment.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

coach!</p>

me! And what about yourself that turned
me to be a hypocrite?</p>

<p>What are you saying?</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>You did, I tell you! Weren’t you always at
me to be regular and to be working and to be
going through the day and the night without
company and to be thinking of nothing but the
trade? What did I want with a trade? I got
a sight of the fairy gold one time in the mountains.
I would have found it again and brought
riches from it but for you keeping me so close
to the work.</p>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>
<p>Oh, of all the ungrateful creatures! You
know well that I cherished you, leading you to
live a decent, respectable life.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>You never had respect for the ancient ways.
It is after the mother you take it, that was too
soft and too lumpish, having too much of the
English in her blood. Martin is a Hearne like

<p>Well, you are great heroes and great warriors
and great lads altogether, to have put down the
Brownes the way you did, yourselves and the
Whiteboys of the quarry. To have ransacked
the house and have plundered it! Look at the
silks and the satins and the grandeurs I brought
away! Look at that now! [<i>Holds up a velvet
cloak.</i>] It’s a good little jacket for myself will
come out of it. It’s the singers will be stopping
their songs and the jobbers turning from their
cattle in the fairs to be taking a view of the
laces of it and the buttons! It’s my far-off
cousins will be drawing from far and near!</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>There was not so much gold in it all as what
they were saying there was. Or maybe that
fleet of Whiteboys had the place ransacked
before we ourselves came in. Bad cess to them
that put it in my mind to go gather up the full
of my bag of horseshoes out of the forge. Silver
they were saying they were, pure white silver;
and what are they in the end but only hardened
iron! A bad end to them! [<i>Flings away horseshoes.</i>]
The time I will go robbing big houses
again it will not be in the light of the full moon
I will go doing it, that does be causing every
common thing to shine out as if for a deceit
and a mockery. It’s not shining at all they are
at this time, but duck yellow and dark.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>To leave the big house blazing after us, it was
that crowned all! Two houses to be burned to
ashes in the one night. It is likely the servant-girls
were rising from the feathers and the cocks
crowing from the rafters for seven miles around,
taking the flames to be the whitening of the
dawn.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>It is the lad is stretched beyond you have to
be thankful to for that. There was never seen
a leader was his equal for spirit and for daring.
Making a great scatter of the guards the way
he did. Running up roofs and ladders, the fire
in his hand, till you’d think he would be apt to
strike his head against the stars.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>I partly guessed death was near him, and the
queer shining look he had in his two eyes, and
he throwing sparks east and west through the
beams. I wonder now was it some inward wound
he got, or did some hardy lad of the Brownes
give him a tip on the skull unknownst in the
fight? It was I myself found him, and the troop
of the Whiteboys gone, and he lying by the
side of a wall as weak as if he had knocked a
mountain. I failed to waken him trying him
with the sharpness of my nails, and his head fell
back when I moved it, and I knew him to be
spent and gone.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>It’s a pity you not to have left him where he
was lying and said no word at all to Paudeen or
to that son you have, that kept us back from
following on, bringing him here to this shelter
on sacks and upon poles.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>What way could I help letting a screech out
of myself, and the life but just gone out of him
in the darkness, and not a living Christian by
his side but myself and the great God?</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>It’s on ourselves the vengeance of the red
soldiers will fall, they to find us sitting here the
same as hares in a tuft. It would be best for us
follow after the rest of the army of the Whiteboys.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>Whisht! I tell you. The lads are cracked
about him. To get but the wind of the word of
leaving him, it’s little but they’d knock the

<p>Maybe so, maybe so. It seems to me yesterday
his cheeks were bloomy all the while, and
now he is as pale as wood ashes. Sure we all
must come to it at the last. Well, my white-headed
darling, it is you were the bush among
us all, and you to be cut down in your prime.
Gentle and simple, everyone liked you. It is
no narrow heart you had, it is you were for
spending and not for getting. It is you made
a good wake for yourself, scattering your estate
in one night only in beer and in wine for the
whole province; and that you may be sitting
in the middle of Paradise and in the chair of
the Graces!</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>Amen to that. It’s pity I didn’t think the
time I sent for yourself to send the little lad of
a messenger looking for a priest to overtake him.
It might be in the end the Almighty is the best
man for us all!</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Sure I sent him on myself to bid the priest
to come. Living or dead I would wish to do
all that is rightful for the last and the best of
my own race and generation.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY [<i>jumping up</i>].</div>
<p>Is it the priest you are bringing in among us?
Where is the sense in that? Aren’t we robbed
enough up to this with the expense of the
candles and the like?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>If it is that poor starved priest he called to
that came talking in secret signs to the man
that is gone, it is likely he will ask nothing for
what he has to do. There is many a priest is
a Whiteboy in his heart.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>I tell you, if you brought him tied in a bag
he would not say an Our Father for you, without
you having a half-crown at the top of your
fingers.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>There is no priest is any good at all but a
spoiled priest. A one that would take a drop
of drink, it is he would have courage to face
the hosts of trouble. Rout them out he would,
the same as a shoal of fish from out the weeds.
It’s best not to vex a priest, or to run against
them at all.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>It’s yourself humbled yourself well to one the
time you were sick in the gaol and had like to
die, and he bade you to give over the throwing
of the cups.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Ah, plaster of Paris I gave him. I took to
it again and I free upon the roads.</p>
<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>
<p>Much good you are doing with it to yourself
or any other one. Aren’t you after telling that
corpse no later than yesterday that he was coming
within the best day of his life?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>Whisht, let ye. Here is the priest coming.</p>
<div class="enter"><i><span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> comes in.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>It is surely not true that he is dead?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>The spirit went from him about the middle
hour of the night. We brought him here to
this sheltered place. We were loth to leave him
without friends.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>taking up sacks</i>].</div>
<p>Lying there stiff and stark. He has a very
quiet look as if there was no sin at all or no
great trouble upon his mind.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>kneels and touches him</i>].</div>
<p>He is not dead.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY [<i>pointing to <span class="small">NANNY</span></i>].</div>
<p>He is dead. If it was letting on he was, he
would not have let that one rob him and search
him the way she did.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>It has the appearance of death, but it is not
death. He is in a trance.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>Is it Heaven and Hell he is walking at this
time to be bringing back newses of the sinners
in pain?</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>I was thinking myself it might away he was,
riding on white horses with the riders of the
forths.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>He will have great wonders to tell out the
time he will rise up from the ground. It is a
pity he not to waken at this time and to lead
us on to overcome the troop of the English.
Sure those that are in a trance get strength, that
they can walk on water.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>It was Father John wakened him yesterday
the time he was lying in the same way. Wasn’t
I telling you it was for that I called to him?</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Waken him now till they’ll see did I tell
any lie in my foretelling. I knew well by the
signs, he was coming within the best day of his
life.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>And not dead at all! We’ll be marching to
attack Dublin itself within a week. The horn
will blow for him, and all good men will gather
to him. Hurry on, Father, and waken him.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I will not waken him. I will not bring him
back from where he is.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>And how long will it be before he will waken
of himself?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Maybe to-day, maybe to-morrow, it is hard
to be certain.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>If it is <i>away</i> he is he might be away seven
years. To be lying like a stump of a tree and
using no food and the world not able to knock
a word out of him, I know the signs of it well.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>We cannot be waiting and watching through
seven years. If the business he has started is to
be done we have to go on here and now. The
time there is any delay, that is the time the
Government will get information. Waken him
now, Father, and you’ll get the blessing of the
generations.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I will not bring him back. God will bring
him back in his own good time. For all I know
he may be seeing the hidden things of God.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>He might slip away in his dream. It is best
to raise him up now.</p>
<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>
<p>Waken him, Father John. I thought he was
surely dead this time, and what way could I go
face Thomas through all that is left of my lifetime,
after me standing up to face him the way
I did? And if I do take a little drop of an odd
night, sure I’d be very lonesome if I did not
take it. All the world knows it’s not for love
of what I drink, but for love of the people that
do be with me! Waken him, Father, or maybe
I would waken him myself. [<i>Shakes him.</i>]</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Lift your hand from touching him. Leave
him to himself and to the power of God.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>If you will not bring him back why wouldn’t
we ourselves do it? Go on now, it is best for
you to do it yourself.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I woke him yesterday. He was angry with
me, he could not get to the heart of the command.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>If he did not, he got a command from myself
that satisfied him, and a message.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>He did—he took it from you—and how do
I know what devil’s message it may have been
that brought him into that devil’s work, destruction
and drunkenness and burnings! That
was not a message from heaven! It was I
awoke him, it was I kept him from hearing
what was maybe a divine message, a voice of
truth, and he heard you speak and he believed
the message was brought by you. You have
made use of your deceit and his mistaking—you
have left him without house or means to
support him, you are striving to destroy and to
drag him to entire ruin. I will not help you,
I would rather see him die in his trance and
go into God’s hands than awake him and see
him go into hell’s mouth with vagabonds and
outcasts like you!</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>turning to <span class="small">BIDDY</span></i>].</div>
<p>You should have knowledge, Biddy Lally, of
the means to bring back a man that is away.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>The power of the earth will do it through
its herbs, and the power of the air will do it
kindling fire into flame.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>Rise up and make no delay. Stretch out and
gather a handful of an herb that will bring him
back from whatever place he is in.</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Where is the use of herbs, and his teeth
clenched the way he could not use them?</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>Take fire so in the devil’s name, and put it
to the soles of his feet.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>Takes a lighted sod from fire.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Let him alone, I say! [<i>Dashes away the sod.</i></p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>I will not leave him alone! I will not give
in to leave him swooning there and the country
waiting for him to awake!</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>I tell you I awoke him! I sent him into
thieves’ company! I will not have him wakened
again and evil things it maybe waiting to take
hold of him! Back from him, back, I say! Will
you dare to lay a hand on me! You cannot do
it! You cannot touch him against my will!</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Mind yourself, do not be bringing us under
the curse of the Church.</p>
<div class="right">[<i><span class="small">JOHNNY</span> steps back. <span class="small">MARTIN</span> moves.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>It is God has him in His care. It is He is
awaking him. [<i><span class="small">MARTIN</span> has risen to his elbow.</i>]
Do not touch him, do not speak to him, he may
be hearing great secrets.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>That music, I must go nearer—sweet marvellous
music—louder than the trampling of
the unicorns; far louder, though the mountain
is shaking with their feet—high joyous music.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>Hush, he is listening to the music of Heaven!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Take me to you, musicians, wherever you
are! I will go nearer to you; I hear you better
now, more and more joyful; that is strange, it
is strange.</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>He is getting some secret.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>It is the music of Paradise, that is certain,
somebody said that. It is certainly the music
of Paradise. Ah, now I hear, now I understand.
It is made of the continual clashing of swords!</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>That is the best music. We will clash them
sure enough. We will clash our swords and our
pikes on the bayonets of the red soldiers. It
is well you rose up from the dead to lead us!
Come on, now, come on!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Who are you? Ah, I remember—where are
you asking me to come to?</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>To come on, to be sure, to the attack on the
barracks at Aughanish. To carry on the work
you took in hand last night.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>What work did I take in hand last night?
Oh, yes, I remember—some big house—we
burned it down—but I had not understood the
vision when I did that. I had not heard the
command right. That was not the work I was
sent to do.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>Rise up now and bid us what to do. Your
great name itself will clear the road before you.
It is you yourself will have freed all Ireland
before the stooks will be in stacks!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Listen, I will explain—I have misled you.
It is only now I have the whole vision plain.
As I lay there I saw through everything, I know
all. It was but a frenzy that going out to burn
and to destroy. What have I to do with the
foreign army? What I have to pierce is the
wild heart of time. My business is not reformation
but revelation.</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>If you are going to turn back now from leading
us, you are no better than any other traitor
that ever gave up the work he took in hand.
Let you come and face now the two hundred
men you brought out daring the power of the
law last night, and give them your reason for
failing them.</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>I was mistaken when I set out to destroy
Church and Law. The battle we have to fight
is fought out in our own mind. There is a fiery
moment, perhaps once in a lifetime, and in that
moment we see the only thing that matters.
It is in that moment the great battles are lost
and won, for in that moment we are a part of
the host of heaven.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>Have you betrayed us to the naked hangman
with your promises and with your drink? If
you brought us out here to fail us and to ridicule
us, it is the last day you will live!</p>
<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>
<p>The curse of my heart on you! It would be
right to send you to your own place on the flagstone
of the traitors in hell. When once I have
made an end of you I will be as well satisfied
to be going to my death for it as if I was going
home!</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>Father John, Father John, can you not hear?
Can you not see? Are you blind? Are you deaf?</p>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>
<p>What is it? What is it?</p>
<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>
<p>There on the mountain, a thousand white
unicorns trampling; a thousand riders with
their swords drawn—the swords clashing! Oh,
the sound of the swords, the sound of the clashing
of the swords!</p>
<div class="hang2">

[<i>He goes slowly off stage. <span class="small">JOHNNY</span> takes up a
stone to throw at him.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>seizing his arm</i>].</div>
<p>Stop—do you not see he is beyond the world?</p>
<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>Keep your hand off him, Johnny Bacach. If
he is gone wild and cracked, that’s natural.

a sudden are apt to go bad and light in the head.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>
<p>To prey on the mind it does, and rises into
the head. There are some would go over any
height and would have great power in their
madness. It is maybe to some secret cleft he is
going, to get knowledge of the great cure for
all things, or of the Plough that was hidden in
the old times, the Golden Plough.</p>
<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>
<p>It seemed as if he was talking through honey.
He had the look of one that had seen great
wonders. It is maybe among the old heroes of
Ireland he went raising armies for our help.</p>

<p>God take him in his care and keep him from
lying spirits and from all delusions!</p>

them to put around his body. Maybe they

<p>Father John, Heaven is not what we have

and making music, and all strife at an end.
I have seen it, I have been there. The lover
still loves but with a greater passion, and the
rider still rides but the horse goes like the wind
and leaps the ridges, and the battle goes on
always, always. That is the joy of Heaven, continual
battle. I thought the battle was here,
and that the joy was to be found here on earth,
that all one had to do was to bring again the
old wild earth of the stories—but no, it is not
here; we shall not come to that joy, that battle,
till we have put out the senses, everything that
can be seen and handled, as I put out this candle.
[<i>He puts out candle.</i>] We must put out the whole
world as I put out this candle [<i>puts out another

and the light of the sun and the light of the
